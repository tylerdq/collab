# Inviting writing collaborations via Git

As a [digital rhetorician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rhetoric), I am interested in how writing collaborations and digital technologies shape each other. [Git](https://git-scm.com/) enjoys nearly ubiquitous usage in software development but seems to have limited uptake in the digital humanities, potentially due to [perceived opacity](http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/topic/how-ready-are-dhers-to-use-github-for-non-code-projects) of this technical system.

## Benefits of Git for writing collaborations

As I see it, the benefits of using Git to write with others include:

1. Emphasizing transparency (changes to work can be easily audited).  
2. Branching/merging between different states of a project (potentially less anxiety at editing crossroads).  
3. Shifting when and how writing is valued (the product is its own history, not just the most recent version).  

## Options for involvement

I would like to experiment alongside others interested in using Git to support writing collaborations. As such, this repository is simply a seed that may grow in as yet untold ways. I offer a few potential GitHub-based options for those interested in exploring further with me:

1. Contribute ideas and/or concerns to the project [Issues](https://github.com/tylerdq/collab/issues).  
2. Add your information to the [Collaborators](https://github.com/tylerdq/collab/wiki/Collaborators) page of this repository's wiki.  
3. Use the "Fork" button above, make changes to the respository, and [submit a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/).  

I am not necessarily set on GitHub as a platform, and would be interested in exploring additional options including but not limited to the following:

- Keybase's private and encrypted [git repositories](https://keybase.io/blog/encrypted-git-for-everyone) for teams.  
- One or more repositories hosted on [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/).  
- Overleaf's [re-release of direct git integration](https://www.overleaf.com/blog/bringing-the-git-bridge-to-v2-its-here-in-beta) for those interested in writing in [LaTeX](https://www.overleaf.com/blog/636-guest-blog-post-latex-for-the-humanities).  

As a final alternative, please feel free to [drop me a line](https://github.com/tylerdq) if you want to discuss options directly.
